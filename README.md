# My Article

## A Security Challenge for you
As privacy invasion, live freely, individual user rights and security has become a wide concerning topic in the digital age, please consider spend time on reading [A SECURITY CHALLENGE FOR YOU](Documents/SECURITYCHALLENGE/README.md) and see what you, as a developer, can do.

## Your Code Could Kill
What could go wrong on some failing code, causing a software glitch, unintented misbehavior or a malfunction to your code? Read [Your Code Could Kill](./Documents/YOUCODECOULDKILL/README.md) so you never take this lightly.

## How To Install Postgres and run it on Linux
There are various tutorial online which help anyone wants to run postgres on their linux machine. Resources like artiles from Digital Ocean are great. However, I find it difficult to obtain an artile that concentrated on Linux. I wrote this artile in [Medium](https://medium.com/@chadwickau/how-to-install-postgres-on-linux-5c7e507e0b94) and hope that anyone who might want POSTGRES to run on their Linux machine find it helpful.

## Why username SirrorsMoore1975? 
The name `SirrorsMoore1975` came from the case name `Sirros v. Moore 1975` [^1], where the Plaintiff sued the Defendants, a circuit judge and a police officer, for an order the Plaintiff believed the Defendants do not have the jurisdiction to execute. A good read for touching the topics on judges rights and what judges can do during trail.

# Tips  

- Are you concern with your privacy and security on your phone? Try out Goggle Pixel with [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/#about) for the best experience you can have. You can also start from degooglizing your life as your first step if it is too huge a step to take.<br>
- Wanted to get back the control to your computer? Try out [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) and [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) for a smooth transition from your traditional priorietary OS. <br>
- Use [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/libreoffice/) for free, security and private Documentation alternatives. Support the developer by buying them a coffee!<br>
- Have trouble installing postgreSQL on Linux ? Try out my tutorial at medium [here](https://medium.com/@chadwickau/how-to-install-postgres-on-linux-5c7e507e0b94). <br>
