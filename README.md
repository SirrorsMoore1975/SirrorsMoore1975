## My Article

### A Security Challenge for you

As privacy invasion, live freely, individual user rights and security has become
a wide concerning topic in the digital age, please consider spend time on reading
[[A SECURITY CHALLENGE FOR YOU](Documents/SECURITYCHALLENGE/README.md)]
and see what you, as a developer, can do.

### Your Code Could Kill

What could go wrong on some failing code, causing a software glitch, unintented
misbehavior or a malfunction to your code? Read [[Your Code Could Kill](./Documents/YOUCODECOULDKILL/README.md)]
so you never take this lightly.

### How To Install Postgres and run it on Linux

There are various tutorial online which help anyone wants to run postgres on their
linux machine. Resources like artiles from Digital Ocean are great. However,
I find it difficult to obtain an artile that concentrated on Linux. 
I wrote [[this](https://medium.com/@chadwickau/how-to-install-postgres-on-linux-5c7e507e0b94)]
article in [[Medium](https://medium.com/)]
and hope that anyone who might want POSTGRES to run on their Linux machine find
it helpful.

### Why username SirrorsMoore1975?

The name `SirrorsMoore1975` came from the case name `Sirros v. Moore 1975` [^1],
where the Plaintiff sued the Defendants, a circuit judge and a police officer,
for an order the Plaintiff believed the Defendants do not have the jurisdiction to
execute. A good read for touching the topics on judges rights and what judges can
do during trail.
