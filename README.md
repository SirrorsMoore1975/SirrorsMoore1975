# A Security Challenge for you
As privacy invasion, live freely, individual user rights and security has become a wide concerning topic in the digital age, please consider spend time on reading [A SECURITY CHALLENGE FOR YOU](Documents/SECURITYCHALLENGE.md) and see what you, as a developer, can do.


# Why username SirrorsMoore1975? 
The name `SirrorsMoore1975` came from the case name `Sirros v. Moore 1975` [^1], where the Plaintiff sued the Defendants, a circuit judge and a police officer, for an order the Plaintiff believed the Defendants do not have the jurisdiction to execute. A good read for touching the topics on judges rights and what judges can do during trail.
