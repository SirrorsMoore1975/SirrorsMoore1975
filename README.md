## My Article

### A Security Challenge for you

As privacy invasion, live freely, individual user rights and security has become
a wide concerning topic in the digital age, please consider spend time on reading
[[A SECURITY CHALLENGE FOR YOU](Documents/SECURITYCHALLENGE/README.md)]
and see what you, as a developer, can do.

### Your Code Could Kill

What could go wrong on some failing code, causing a software glitch, unintented
misbehavior or a malfunction to your code? Read [[Your Code Could Kill](./Documents/YOUCODECOULDKILL/README.md)]
so you never take this lightly.

### How To Install Postgres and run it on Linux

There are various tutorial online which help anyone wants to run postgres on their
linux machine. Resources like artiles from Digital Ocean are great. However,
I find it difficult to obtain an artile that concentrated on Linux.
I wrote [[this](https://medium.com/@chadwickau/how-to-install-postgres-on-linux-5c7e507e0b94)]
article in [[Medium](https://medium.com/)]
and hope that anyone who might want POSTGRES to run on their Linux machine find
it helpful.

### Why username SirrorsMoore1975?

The name `SirrorsMoore1975` came from the case name `Sirros v. Moore 1975` [^1],
where the Plaintiff sued the Defendants, a circuit judge and a police officer,
for an order the Plaintiff believed the Defendants do not have the jurisdiction to
execute. A good read for touching the topics on judges rights and what judges can
do during trail.

## Tips  

- Are you concern with your privacy and security on your phone?
Try out Goggle Pixel with [[GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/#about)]
for the best experience you can have. You can also start from degooglizing your
life as your first step if it is too huge a step to take.

  - Recently, GrapheneOS realized some mobile APPs has banned GrapheneOS based on
  of some misinfo or might have leaning toward big tech interest,
  read their short article section
  [[Apps Banning GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/articles/attestation-compatibility-guide#apps-banning-grapheneos)
  ]
  (30 second reading) and consider aiding GrapheneOS
  to continue their excellent project

    - With `Chat Control` in the EU is getting more political than ever, France
    authorities are spreading false accusation in their media and threaten arrest
    and seizures sever of GrapheneOS. French citizen can still use GrapheneOS, but
    all GrapheneOS operations are now ended in France. The tech `disk encryption` are
    now considered by some country as `illegal`, if the encryption does not allow
    backdoor for authorities to get into. Those who has projects that is operating
    in those countries, like France, are required to provide `forced backdoor` so
    the authorities can have access to citizens' phone, despite no law has been
    implemented at the time of _requesting_ and even if the so called backdoor is
    technologically impossible due to hardware limitation such as the Pixel Phone
    by design where GrapheneOS is using.
