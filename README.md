# A Security Challenge for you

# Why username SirrorsMoore1975? 
The name `SirrorsMoore1975` came from the case name `Sirros v. Moore 1975` [^1], where the Plaintiff sued the Defendants, a circuit judge and a police officer, for an order the Plaintiff believed the Defendants do not have the jurisdiction to execute. A good read for touching the topics on judges rights and what judges can do during trail.
