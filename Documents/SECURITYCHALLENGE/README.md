# Introduction
No one will wish their user data are sold to some unknown person(s) or an unknown third parties or entities for their own good, or having his/her private life widely open to all others, and not even for any security reason(s). 

Aside from those malicious hackers and/or attacking groups, over the decade, some well known big tech companies are having high concern over privacy invasion, harvesting user data, security breaches while users are trying to use their technologies provided. Obviously, their tech are by no mean a very conveninence tools to use and has make our life much more easier. Some level of private data are ought to be necessary for some of those tech to work. However, this still gives them __NO RIGHTS__ to use the data as if they own them. How far this __for the better user experience__ should go? I believe as a developer, we got a duty to protect our users from all that, within our limits and abilities.

The purpose of this article is to let developer who might be aware of, or value, security and privacy to pay more attention to what they are building for their users/clients.

- It is always my pleasure to work with others who might be coming from the big tech companies industry, but I am discouraged in working at the big tech companies when the tech, product or software they are using has security, privacy or user rights and freedom concerns.

- This article intention is to let anyone around, especially developers who might be using the big tech companies' tech to build their products, softwares or applications, to grow awareness of, or to influence those developers or others who build products, software or applications for their users to, users' protection over their user's freedom and privacy, and that, it should always be their utmost priority to secure their user, and this goal shall be upheld at all cost. 

## Are you the right kind of person? 
To begin with, you needed to ask yourself a few questions:-

### Fair Warning: It is a challenge that is not for everyone
How far can we depart ourselves as a developer from the protection on invasion of privacy and security in today modern world? It is difficult since:- 
- it depends on the client's needs or demands;
- alternative tech are not propular;
- the techs are available but not mature;
- alternatives tech are none existence; 
- the infrastructure of the tech your working company are relying upon, of which it does not allow you to depart from;
- the services your working company are supplying to their clients cannot be, or afford to, change (due to time, contract terms, instructions, etc); and,
- the developer's tech preferences or habits:-
  - they might not have the time (or have the time to learn new alternatives), 
  - worries that the shift would lower their professional abilities, or 
  - they have show no interests at all to learn alternative (or maybe he/she cannot provide further efforts for a change due to some reasonable reasons)

Open, free and secure might sound ideal for some, so this challenge, I wished those who still can resist or afford to do so, like people who are starting a business or those who are willing to change and still can change, accept this as your challenge. By not helping or not aiding on selling your user data to a third parties without user consent is already a good start.

## Where can we start?

Try looking at the following points:
### Alternative software
Is there alternative software or application that can achieve the same goal you are doing? 

You will be supprised to learn there are alternative softwares that might be free and open sources and are maintained by a communities or developers. 

However, it is not always the case that there are available alternatives. If this become the case, consider maybe:-
- build an alternative application replacing it yourself, if possible;
- use the unfortunate software or application, for the moment, and wait until such alternative available and switch to it 

But, as mentioned above, you or your team might be limited by the companies or clients who you are working with, such actions might not be appreciated by those who you are working with (in terms of cost, time, money, patient, skills,resources, demands, tech available, etc). Just try to search for alternative, within your capacity and limitation.

### Recognize the technology source
Look who is providing the technology, for instant, the FAANG gangs, M$, etc? Or some open source communities with __sounds__ reputation? 

### Do not become part of the engine of that invasion
Things to think about:
- How far __"For the better user experiences"__ should go? Infinite? As far as your companies demand them? As far as your client demand them? 

- Is the collection of the data are absolute necessary? eg, Why would a calculator app needed access to your phone contact list, audio and camera access, etc?

- If you are already part of the collecting data campaign, ask how do you minimize or even withdraw yourself from it, if your siutation (physically, financially, legally, etc) allow you to do so?

Sometime, it is not a question of whether can we do it or not, it is the question if you wanted to do it or not.

## Understand that...
- Users' data are not assets that are for politics, groups, organization, individual, companies or any entities imaginable to harvest, invested, sold out or manipulate upon. And that, it is absolutely not for users' tendencies manipulating, or being weaponized to use for or against particular, or group(s) of, user or for any person(s)/group(s) at their benefits/disadvantages.
- There are no such things as to<br />
  - `sacrifice freedom for security` or<br />
  - `I have nothing to hide (but have nothing to give either)`<br />
Freedom and security can be __BOTH__ obtained at the same time and __ARE NOT__ mutually exclusive to each other.
- Their tech are by no means a very convenience tools, but exposing your user to high risk of security, such as:-
  - letting them to know where your user(s) lives; or, 
  - sending user(s) email data for their better marketing tactics on their user(s); or, 
  - a calendar or email apps that leaks info of your meeting(s) or dates with someone; or
  - w/o user knowledge or consent: 
    - accessing device camera, 
    - reading folders and files, 
    - accessing device audio, 
    - tracking user locations, 
    - collecting/transferring user's device data to somewhere, etc; 
  <br />
  are really way too much and must be stopped. <br />
- You as a developer has:-
  - No rights to control what kind of contents, moral, believes or thoughts your user can or cannot have. 


# Share this challenge
Is this you?
- Do you treasure freedom for user, user privacy, security, user rights, individual thoughts and values?
- Is your position (your jobs, titles, etc) and/or situation (fiancially, legally, etc) your currently in, or about to be in, allow you to make a different? The changes will not be making your life become more miserable or unsubstainable;
- Is it within your powers, abilities or decisions to make the change?
- You are using big tech companies tech and willing to change:
  - And you know that there are alternative tech available;<br />
OR 
  - However, the tech is not yet available but you think you can help contributing;


Then challenge yourself and share that:

I am determined that:-
- [x] I __WILL NOT__ become an accomplice of those companies to become the engine of invasion to invade my application's users;
- [x] I __WILL__ respect my users rights and freedoms throught out and __WILL NOT__, in a harmful way, sold out my users' data for benefits or any other usage but only sololy or purely for the use of my applications.
- [x] It is my utmost priority to ensure my user security and shall be upheld at all cost
- [x] I have __NO RIGHTS__ to enforce my individual or community believes or thoughts, political motives or morality onto any groups or individual user.
- [x] I promoise, on the best of my knowledge and skill, to provide secure and open software to my user, and I promise no privacy invasion shall be conduct upon user of the software I created.
