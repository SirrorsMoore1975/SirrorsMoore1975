# A Security Challenge For You

A Security Challenge for you

[[Go Back](../../README.md)]

## Introduction

No one will wish their user data are sold to some unknown person(s) or an unknown
third parties or entities for their own good, or having his/her private life widely
open to all others, and not even for any security reason(s).

Aside from those malicious hackers and/or attacking groups, over the decade,
 some well known big tech companies are known to have a high concern over "privacy
 invasion", "harvesting user data", "security breaches", etc.,
 while users are trying to us their technologies provided.

 Their tech are by no mean a very conveninence tools to use and has make our life
 much more easier to live, and that, some level of private data are necessary
 for some of those tech, software or scripts to work.
 However, this still gives them __NO RIGHTS__ to use the data as if they own them.
 We often heard the term __for the better user experience__,
 but how far this __for the better user experience__ should go?
 As a developer, we are suppose to protect our users from all that, within our
 limits and abilities.

This article intention is to let anyone around, especially developers who might
 be using the big tech companies' tech to build their products, softwares or
 applications, to grow awareness of, or to influence those developers, others or
 team members who build products, software or applications for their users to
 users' protection over their user's freedom and privacy, and that, it should
 always be their utmost priority to secure their user, and this goal shall be
 upheld at all cost.

### I am not against big tech

- It is always my pleasure to work with others who might be coming from the big tech
 companies industry, but what I am discouraged is working at the big tech companies
 when the tech, products, scripts or software they are using has security,
 privacy or user rights and freedom breaches concerns.

## Fair Warning

### Are you the right kind of person?

To begin with, you needed to ask yourself a few questions:-

1. It is not a challenge for everyone

   How far can we depart ourselves as a developer from the protection on invasion
   of privacy and security in today modern world? It is difficult since:-
      - it depends on the client's needs or demands;
      - alternative tech are not propular;
      - the techs are available but not mature;
      - alternatives tech are none existence;
      - the infrastructure of the tech your working company are relying upon, of
      which it does not allow you to depart from;
      - the services your working company are supplying to their clients cannot be
      or afford to, change (due to time, contract terms, instructions, etc); and,
      - the developer's tech preferences or habits:-
      - they might not have the time (or have the time to learn new alternatives),
      - worries that the shift would lower their professional abilities, or
      - they have show no interests at all to learn alternative (or maybe he/she
      cannot provide further efforts for a change due to some reasonable reasons)
  
   Open, free and secure might sound ideal for some, so this challenge, I wished
  those who still can resist or afford to do so, like people who are starting a
  business or those who are willing to change and still can change, accept this as
  your challenge. Little effort still count. By not aiding on selling your user
  data to a third parties without user consent is already a good start.

1. Where can we start?

    Try looking at the following points:

    1. Alternative software
  
       - Is there alternative software or application that can achieve the same goal
     you are doing?
  
         You will be supprised to learn there are alternative softwares that might
       be free and open sources and are maintained by a communities or developers.
  
         However, it is not always the case that there are available alternatives.
       If this become the case, consider maybe:-

         - build an alternative application replacing it yourself, if possible;
         - use the unfortunate software or application, for the moment, and wait
        until such alternative available and switch to it
  
         But, as mentioned above, you or your team might be limited by the
       companies or clients who you are working with, such actions might not be
       appreciated by those who you are working with (in terms of cost, time,
       money, patient, skills, resources, demands, tech available, etc). Just try
       to search for alternative within your capacity and limitation.
  
    1. Recognize the technology source
  
        Look who is providing the technology, for instant, the FAANG gangs, M$, etc?
        Or some open source communities with __sounds__ reputation?

1. Do not become part of the engine of that invasion

      Things to think about:

      - How far __"For the better user experiences"__ should go? Infinite?
As far as your companies demand them? As far as your client demand them?

      - Is the collection of the data are absolute necessary?
       eg, Why would a calculator app needed access to your phone contact list,
 audio and camera access, etc

      - If you are already part of the collecting data campaign, ask how do you
      minimize or even withdraw yourself from it,
      if your siutation (physically, financially, legally, etc) allow you to do so?

     Sometime, it is not a question of whether can we do it or not,
     it is the question if you wanted to do it or not.

1. Understand that

    - Users' data are not assets that are for politics, groups, organization,
 individual, companies or any entities imaginable to harvest, invested, sell,
 sold out or manipulate upon. And that, it is absolutely not for users' tendencies
 manipulating, or being weaponized to use for or against particular, or group(s)
 of, user or for any person(s)/group(s) at their benefits/disadvantages.

    - There are no such things as to:
  
      - `sacrifice freedom for security` or
      - `I have nothing to hide (but have nothing to give either)`

        Freedom and security can be __BOTH__ obtained at the same time and
        __ARE NOT__ mutually exclusive to each other.

    - Their tech are by no means a very convenience tools, but exposing your user
to high risk of security, such as:-

    - letting them to know where your user(s) lives; or,
    - sending user(s) email data for their better marketing tactics on their user(s);
      or,
    - a calendar or email apps that leaks info of your meeting(s) or dates with someone;
      or
      - w/o user knowledge or consent:
         - accessing device camera,
         - reading folders and files,
         - accessing device audio,
         - tracking user locations,
         - collecting/transferring user's device data to somewhere, etc;
  
         are really way too much and must be stopped.

    - You as a developer has:-
      - No rights to control what kind of contents, moral, believes or thoughts
  your user can or cannot have.
