# I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE

I have nothing to hide.

## It is just a slogan so you give up privacy

> __I have nothing to hide, so there is nothing to fear.__

Well, you should.

This argument or slogan is often used by government, politian, legislators or big
tech to divert those from the important protection of privacy, blurring and
losing the focus that privacy is trying to protect you from, allowing authorities
to gain more abusive power over individual and let yourself to be living much
closer to a dystopian future.

Privacy is not a trade off for security. Allowing private data to be opened
does not proven your innocent either. The authority only care if they convict
any targets they believed that is in breach of their law. Your innocent are
not justice to the authority. Your conviction is their version of justice
that they want to present it to the public.

If I cannot stress that enough already, __privacy is about protecting yourself__,
__protect free thought and freedom of expression__.

Those who keep telling you that __you have nothing to worry about__ might be because:

- they have not think enough or did not understand what the stack privacy is
about; or
- that they are under some influence or believe, maybe in the name of
justice, that they will be justified, or proven innocent, by being open to
the powerful; or
- they have received beneficial aids, where their interest originated, from
the authorities to speak good things about their actions; or
- they are working under the powerful influence that they cannot speak
against, it could be legal, financial or political pressure,
it can also be a pressure from some unacceptable moral, such as
being held hostage of their love one; or
- they are the one behind who is pushing the parliament motion, the bill, the
policy, etc., for some he/she only knows reason(s);

If you are still not convinced, how about an officer on street tell you this:

> __Since there is nothing to hide, show me your phone right now and unlocked__
__it?__

All of a suddenly, you care about privacy because it is your messages, your photos
and your history, opened up to the public and authority to see, it is
now in someone else hand, free from their interpretation imaginable on
how wicked you are, no matter how innocent your private seems to be.

## __Privacy protect you from living in a dystopian future.__

Privacy are never about hiding something. It protects `your dignity`,
`your future freedom`, `your autonomy`, `your digital life safety`,
even can be extended to `your physical safety`. `Privacy` is all about
`protecting yourself`. It is the basic rights you can have, beyond using
certain devices or applications. And it is not a trade off for security or
authority protection.

When you allow your device being scanned without any protection, you
essentially allow your life to become open to anyone to explore. A stranger
will know your daughter, your love one, or someone you care a lot.
Your messages about a popular figure will be opened to everyone to see.
Your data will be sold openly. Your face will be used to frame to something you
never did. Your money will not be yours anymore.

Privacy allow you to stay in control to your digital freedom, allow you to
have free thought and free expression without fear.

## Why is Live Free important

Live free is essential for creativity. Without it, you are just the
authorities' puppet. You lost your rights to speak up. No one can try to
question, scrutinize an authority, seek for information that the authorities
not pleased, do not willing to answer, not willing to cooperate or not willing to
share those information. Those who speak up might be put away, threaten, beaten
up or silenced. When you are in pain you cannot yell. When you are hungry you
are not allow to say it. You wanted to speak up something in the social media
for your justice? Your post will be gone and you are likely being interviewed
by someone to not to speak or never be seen again. You will be required by
law to surrender, comply to the law and only do things the authorities
pleased. Anyone who has woke up and speak up, others will be calling you
nonsense, or to keep you quiet to avoid troubles on themselves. When you seek
help, others will not help you. When you try to protest, you are taken down
before you even try to start. You will self-censor yourself and cannot complain
at all, because when you do, beside arrest, you or your love one will be in danger.

## The Unhackable Phone incident

On or about 2024 emergence the `unhackable phone` which notoriously known as
the criminals goes to phone for criminal to avoid being tracked by the
government or the law enforcement. Forces in `Belgium`, `France` and
`the Netherland` has infiltrated and decoded messages of the unhackable phone.

With the success in fighting organized crime via the infiltration, this
sparks the public debates between personal privacy and security. New measures
and laws are make to secure national security rather than protection of
privacy.

In some countries, such as `France`, has been actively framing projects such
as `GrapheneOS` as aiding those organized crime, where all their methods,
such as encryption, are legally obtained, none of their actions or provided
features breaches any law, but with __national security__ in mind, the
authority threaten to imprison developers if not surrender, has make
`GrapheneOS` to stop all their operation in `France`.

## The War of Privacy

While you are using public, open, no law prohibited, open-sourced
applications scripts or codes, you find yourself being targeted and are
treated like you are a criminal (not even a suspect before charged guilty by
a law court).

The the Co-Founder of the application of crypto currencies `Samourai Wallet`
has been imprisoned only because he developed a privacy tool for crypto
currencies and was treated like he is part of the money laundering that the
criminal used. He fight and did everything he could in court to clear his
name, and he did __NOTHING__ wrong, hitting the right note and has never
pleaded guilty, the court ignored the laws and the rules lied down in the
country and ignored the evidence he put in front of the court and still hand
down verdict of guilty and has sentenced him imprisonment for 5 years. The
rules are that *you needed to be participated into the crime, not because you
are just merely involved in creating a tool the criminal is using*. See [the interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fshsk8MCAf4&t=885s)
{:target="_blank"} before he is imprisoned.

A former young data analyst who worked for the government intelligent has
fled from his home country only because he realized the country has been
secretly invading the public privacy of the entire planet through TVs,
monitors and phones without the user consent or law court order. He is still
a wanted fugitive by the government for exposing the secret operation on
individual privacy. The local Constitution that protect individual privacy
are just ignored or interpreted otherwise.

Australia are now restricting any person below the age of 16 to use a list of
applications and social media so that harmful contents are not reached by the
teenagers, but somehow the controversial `DISCORD` and `Roblox` which are
__privacy and child safety concerning__, they are
somehow not included. This make commentator questioning, was it about protecting
children, or is it about censor those platform the authority did not like?

`Chat Control`, `VPN` and `Crypto Currencies` targeted in the EU are not
going away, despite public raise concern and debated constantly.
Decentralizing tools and encrypted messengers are often targeted by the
government. Developers has to lower their standard of privacy to avoid being
targeted, jailed or fined, like some projects: `/e/OS`, `Murena` and
`Fairphone`.
In December 2025, `GrapheneOS` has to leave France because they
refused (or it is impossible to do so due to device limits) to lower
their privacy standard.

- Can we shutdown the entire car industries because a car knock down and
killed people?
- Can we shutdown the entire beer manufacture because someone get drunk and
start killing people?
- Do we get rid of any kitchen knife or cutter blades when someone used it to
injure or murder people?

## Final message

If you are a developer, do not join the camp that is actively engage with the privacy
invasion or censorship. And, be safe.

Criminal hiding behind privacy used it as their shield should be shameful of
themselves. But would you rather any innocent persons / developers are being
convicted, run the justice that only the authority wanted, so you / someone go to
prison for doing nothing wrong, such as for developing an application that is
totally legal and did not involved into any crime?

If you said you don't care about privacy, it is the same saying you
don't care about free speech, and you are giving up all your freedom.
Privacy is no about hiding something, it is a power to keep you free.
