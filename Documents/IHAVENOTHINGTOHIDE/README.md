# I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE

## It is just a slogan so you give up privacy

> __I have nothing to hide, let them search my devices, justice is by my side, why should I fear?__ 

Well, you should.

This argument or slogan is often used by politian or legislators to divert yourself from the important protection of privacy, bluring and losing the focus that privacy is trying to protect you from, allowing authorities to gain more abusive power over individual and let yourself to be living much closer to a dystopian future.

Privacy is not a trade off for security. Allowing private data to be opened does not proven your innocent either. The authority only care if they convict any targets they believed that is in breach of their law. Your innocent are not justice to the authority. Your conviction is their version of justice that they want to present it to the public.

If I cannot stress that enough already, __privacy is about protecting yourself__.

Those who keep telling you that you have nothing to worry about might be because:
- they have not think enough or did not understand what the stack privacy is about; or 
- that they are under some influence or believe, maybe in the name of justice, that they will be justified, or proven innocent, by being open to the powerful; or 
- they have received beneficial aids, where their interest originated, from the authorities to speak good things about their actions; or 
- they are working in those departments under the powerful influence that they cannot speak against, it could be legal, financial or political pressure; or
- they are the one behind who is pushing the parliament motion, the bill, the policy, etc., for some he/she only knows reason(s);

__Privacy protect you from living in a dystopian future.__

Privacy are never about hiding something. It protects `your dignity`, `your future freedom`, `your autonomy`, `your digital life safety`, even can be extended to `your physical safety`. `Privacy` is all about `protecting yourself`. It is the basic rights you can have, beyond using certain devices or applications. And it is not a trade off for security or authority protection.

When you allow your device being scanned without any protection, you essentially allow your life to become open to anyone to explore. A stranger will know your daughter. Your data will be sold openly. Your face will be used to frame to something you never did. Your money will not be yours anymore.

Privacy allow you to stay in control to your digital freedom, allow you to have free throught and free expression without fear.

## Why is Live Free important

Live free is essential for creativity. Without it, you are just the authorities' puppet. You lost your rights to speak up. No one can try to question, scrutinize, seek for informations that the authorities not pleased, do not willing to answer, not willing to cooperate or not willing to share those informations. Those who speak up might be put away, threaten, beaten up or silenced. When you are in pain you cannot yell. When you are hungry you are not allow to say it. You wanted to speak up something in the social media for your justice? Your post will be gone and you are likely being interviewed by someone to not to speak or never be seen again. You will be required by law to surrender, comply to the law and only do things the authorities pleased. Anyone who has woke up and speak up, others will be calling you nonsense, or to keep you quiet to avoid troubles on themselves. When you seek help, others will not help you. When you try to protest, you are taken down before you even try to start.

## The Unhackable Phone incident

On or about 2024 emergence the `unhackable phone` which notoriously known as the criminals goes to phone for criminal to avoid being tracked by the governemnt or the law enforcement. Forces in `Belgium`, `France` and `the Netherland` has infiltrated and decoded messages of the unhackable phone.

With the success in fighting organized crime via the infiltration, this sparks the public debates between personal privacy and security. New measures and laws are make to secure national security rather than protection of privacy. 

In some countries, such as `France`, has been actively framing projects such as `GrapheneOS` as aiding those organized crime, where all their methods, such as encryption, are legally obtained, none of their actions or provided features breaches any law, but with __national security__ in mind, the authority threaten to imprison developers if not surrender, has make `GrapheneOS` to stop all their operation in `France`.

## The War of Privacy

While you are using public, open, no law prohibited, open-sourced applications scripts or codes, you find yourself being targeted and are treated like you are a criminal (not even a suspect before charged guilty by a law court).

The the Co-Founder of the application of crypto currencies `Samourai Wallet` has been imprisoned only because he developed a privacy tool for crypto currencies and was treated like he is part of the money laundering that the criminal used. He fighted and did everything he could in court to clear his name, and he did __NOTHING__ wrong, hitting the right note and has never pleaded guilty, the court ignored the laws and the rules lied down in the country and ignored the evidence he put in front of the court and still hand down verdict of guilty and has sentenced him imprisonment for 5 years. The rules are that *you needed to be participated into the crime, not because you are just merely involved in creating a tool the criminal is using*. See [the interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fshsk8MCAf4&t=885s){:target="_blank"} before he is imprisoned.

A former young data analyst who worked for the government intelligent has fled from his home country only because he realized the country has been secretly invading the public privacy of the entire planet through TVs, monitors and phones without the user consent or law court order. He is still a wanted fugitive by the government for exposing the secret operation on individual privacy. The local Consititution that protect individual privacy are just ignored or interpreted otherwise.

Australia are now restricting any person below the age of 16 to use a list of applications and soical media so that harmful contents are not reached by the teenages, but somehow the controversial `DISCORD` and `Roblox` which are somehow not included. This make commentator question was it about protect children or censor those platform the authority did not like.

`Chat Control`, `VPN` and `Crypto Currencies` targeted in the EU are not going away, despite public raise concern and debated constantly. Decentralizing tools and encrypted messengers are often targeted by the government. Developers has to lower their standard of privacy to avoid being targeted, jailed or fined, like some projects: `/e/OS`, `Murena` and `Fairphone`.

- Can we shutdown the entire car industries because a car knock down and killed people?
- Can we shutdown the entire beer manufacture because someone get drunk and start killing people?
- Do we get rid of any kitchen knife or cutter blades when someone used it to murder people?
