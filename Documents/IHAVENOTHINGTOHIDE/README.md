# I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE

__Privacy protect you from living in a dystopian future.__

Privacy are never about hiding something. It protects `your dignity`, `your future freedom`, `your autonomy`, `your digital life safety`, even can be extended to `your physical safety`. `Privacy` is all about `protecting yourself`. It is the basic rights you can have, beyond using certain devices or applications. And it is not a trade off for security or authority protection.

When you allow your device being scanned without any protection, you essentially allow your life to become open to anyone to explore. A stranger will know your daughter. Your data will be sold openly. Your face will be used to frame to something you never did. Your money will not be yours anymore.

Privacy allow you to stay in control to your digital freedom, allow you have free throught and expression. Live free is essential for creativity. Without it, you are just authorities puppets. You lost your rights to speak up. When you are in pain you cannot yell. When you are hungry you are not allow to say it. You wanted to say something in the social media? You post will be gone and you are likely being interviewed by someone to not to speak or never be seen again. You will be required by law to surrender, comply to the law and do as the authorities pleased. Anyone who has woke up and speak up, others will be calling you nonsense, or to keep you quiet to avoid troubles on themselves.

## The Unhackable Phone incident

On or about 2024 emergence the `unhackable phone` which notoriously known as the criminals goes to phone for criminal to avoid being tracked by the governemnt or the law enforcement. Forces in `Belgium`, `France` and `the Netherland` has infiltrated and decoded messages of the unhackable phone.

With the success in fighting organized crime via the infiltration, this sparks the public debates between personal privacy and security. New measures and laws are make to secure national security rather than protection of privacy. 

In some countries, such as `France`, has been actively framing projects such as `GrapheneOS` as aiding those organized crime, where all their methods, such as encryption, are legally obtained, none of their actions or provided features breaches any law, but with national security in mind and threaten to imprison developers, has make `GrapheneOS` to stop all their operation in `France`.

## The War of Privacy


- Can someone block your access to the internet simply because someone show harmful contents from some illegitamate website captured nudity, captured overdosed drugs behavior or even captured self-harm contents?
- Can we deny your rights to privacy (or the rights to have encrypted messages) because human trafficker using the messenger to communicate between its criminal kingdom?

This sound crazy? No, it is happening.

While you are using public, open, no law prohibited, open-sourced applications scripts or codes, you find yourself being targeted and are treated like you are a criminal (not even a suspect before charged guilty by a law court). You were using law prohibited rights to ask for debate, reconsider decision made in the Parliament or Legislation, but none of that was listened, and the party has made their mind to treat everyone a potential criminal or crime lord.

The the Co-Founder of the application of crypto currencies `Samourai Wallet` has been imprisoned only because he developed a privacy tool for crypto currencies and was treated like he is part of the money laundering that the criminal used. He fighted and did everything he could in court to clear his name, and he did __NOTHING__ wrong, hitting the right note and has never pleaded guilty, the court ignored the laws and the rules lied down in the country and ignored the evidence in front of the court and still hand down verdict of guilty and has sentence imprisonment him. The rules are that *you needed to be involved into the crime, not because you are merely creating a tool*. See [the interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fshsk8MCAf4&t=885s){:target="_blank"} before he is imprisoned.

A former young data analyst who worked for the government intelligent has fled from his home country only because he realized the country has been secretly invading the public privacy of the entire planet through TVs, monitors and phones without the user consent or law court order. He is still a wanted fugitive by the government for exposing the secret operation on individual privacy.

Digital ID is going all green despite a significant amount of signatures asking a House of Parliament to debate (which has satisfied the rules to re-open the debate) has been ignored and stated it will go ahead no matter what. 

Australia are now restricting any person below the age of 16 to use a list of applications and soical media so that harmful contents are not reached by the teenages, but somehow the controversial `DISCORD` and `Roblox` which are somehow not included.

Chat Control in the EU has not going away, despite EU citizens has raise concern and debated, the EU has only 

- Can we shutdown the entire car industries because a car knock down and killed people?
- Can we shutdown the entire beer manufacture because someone get drunk and start killing people?
- Do we get rid of any kitchen knife when someone used it to murder people?



## I have nothing to hide is just a slogan so you give up privacy

__I have nothing to hide, let them search my devices, why should I fear?__ Well, you should.

It is often used by politian or legislators to make you to divert yourself from the protection of privacy, bluring the important of individual privacy, lossing the focus that privacy is trying to protect you from, allow authorities to gain more abusive power over individual and let yourself to be living much closer to a dystopian future. You lose everything if you believed privacy is about hiding something.
