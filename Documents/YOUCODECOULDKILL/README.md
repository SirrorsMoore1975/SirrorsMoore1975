Coding helped us to live better. What can go wrong?

Coding might sound innocent, a mistake or error in the software or scripts might not have much consequences on the developer or the user. However, a mild one might cause damage$ (damage that come with lossing money). A worst one can cause not just bad reputations, damage$ or fines but injuries, imprisonment or even death.

I came across a case, where a fatal memory error in C has caused a car entering __auto pilot__,  acclerating by itself, crashed the car, killing driver's friend, left driver severe injured, even when the driver did tried all her attempts on pushing hard on the car break [^2].

Another incident, where a 911 system that ignore calls if the 911 hotline is being called for a number of time within a given period, which has fatally caused a victim who tries to report a break in to the house seeking police aid resulted death. 
 
A drug website will always diagnose a forwarding patient to a particular website which sell a particular medicine (for the benefit of the drug company who had hired the DevOp), ignoring the fact that whether the paitent medical history if he/she can or cannot take that medicine, and in result causing a teenage girl death.

Two Boeing Planes crashed together when a potential software error caused the system to fail, killing more than 300 people.

# Where did the errors came from
- __Human Factor__ : a fault that the programmer did not comprehend, ignored, in ignorance of, or the faulty of the programmer part. 

- __Machine Factor__ : the language might be a legacy programming language, the scripts might have exceeded the original purposes or limits.

- __Netural Factor__ : a nuisance that neither caused by human, machine or known facts, but it is such a cause that, such as an Act of God, a situation that no reasonable person could have make any precaution to prevent it from happening or can predict it will happen.

# Can we avoid those errors
We are human, we do not know everything, we make mistakes, but sometime this kind of negligence can also cause damages to us or others and even in the cause of human life.

Back in the 90s, we have Y2K problem (now we are close to another UNIX timestamp limit)

Some mistake can be avoided by practicing more, get yourself more familiar to the languages, do not stand still, continue researching, continue to explore, continue to learn, learn from history, be more open, listen to reasonable feedback, most importantly, check, re-check, re-re-check you code
