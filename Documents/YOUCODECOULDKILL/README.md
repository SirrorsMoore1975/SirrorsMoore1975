[Go Back](../../README.md)

Coding helped us to live better. What can go wrong?

Coding might sound innocent, but as the title suggested, a mistake or an errors in the language, software or codes could inflict consequences on the developer and to the user. 

This article is aimed to help us as a programmer that we really should be taking those programming language decisions, mistakes, errors etc seriously. 

## Are we just being too paranoid? 
A small error might just end at the end of user's browser or on the apps, it might end up as an open issue at GitHub waiting to be resolved, or the issue is completely ignored or is totally forgotten because it beared no consequences. How about an errors that can cause some damage$ (yes, real currency) to the company such as payment to some lawsuit? A program/software is interacting with the real world. How about an error that cause injuries or even death? It won't just end at a lawsuit, gaining some bad reputations or some damage$, but possibly imprisonment.

## Can an error be that worst?
If you have not aware or have not a clue of where I am going at yet, remember this: YOUR CODE CAN KILL. 

I overheard a case online which have me check and read into it, where the case of a fatal memory error in C has caused a car entering __auto pilot mode__ ignoring the driver's input, acclerating by itself, crashed the car, killing driver's friend, left driver severe injured. In the proceedure, the driver has show evidence that desipte how hard on her attempts on pushing hard on the car break, the car just keep accelarating [^2].

Another incident, where a 911 system that ignore calls if the 911 hotline is being called for a number of time within a given period, which happens to have reached the limit and has fatally caused a victim who tries to report a break in to the owner house seeking police aid failed to contact the police and resulted victim's death. 
 
A drug website will always diagnose a forwarding patient to a particular website which sell a particular medicine (for the benefit of the drug company who had hired the DevOp), ignoring the fact that whether the paitent medical history if he/she can or cannot take that medicine, and in result causing a teenage girl death.

Two Boeing Planes crashed together when a potential software error caused the system to fail, killing more than 300 people.

# Where did the errors came from
- __Human Factor__ : a fault that the programmer did not comprehend, ignored, in ignorance of, or the faulty of the programmer part. 

- __Machine Factor__ : this errors came from the design of the language, it might be because it is a legacy programming language, the scripts might have exceeded the original purposes or has reached its limitation or has went far beyond than it was enticipated

- __Netural Factor__ : a nuisance that neither caused by human, machine or known facts, but it is such a cause that, such as an Act of God, a situation that no reasonable person could have make any precaution to prevent it from happening or can predict it will happen.

# What can developer do ...
- Check your code, check again, re-check again. 
- Practice as much as you can. Challenge yourself
- Accept feedback, good or bad one.

# Can we avoid those errors
We are human, we do not know everything, we make mistakes, but sometime this kind of negligence can also cause damages to us or others and even in the cause of human life.

Back in the 90s, we have Y2K problem (now we are close to another UNIX timestamp limit)

Some mistake can be avoided by practicing more, get yourself more familiar to the languages, do not stand still, continue researching, continue to explore, continue to learn, learn from history, be more open, listen to reasonable feedback, most importantly, check, re-check, re-re-check you code
