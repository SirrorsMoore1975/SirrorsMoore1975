# Your Code Could Kill

[Go Back](../../README.md)

## Forward

Programming is supposed to help us to live a better life. What can coding go wrong?

for the moment........

A small mistake or errors will only cause program to crash, so no consequent at all.

A mild mistake or errors that make the financial market closed down for a day, causing financial loses.

A fatal errors, or a deliberate choice, could cause injuries or even death of him or herslf or to its neighbour.

Errors that are foreseeable, an experienced developer shall always tried to avoided them, provide their best solutions as much as possible and as far as possible.

## Example that the programming languages that has caused death

A programming language is the source of the fatal error that has caused a car to accelarate even when the driver has pushed hard on the break, leaving tire marks on the road, has find itself no avail on stopping the car, causing fatal death to her driver's friend and the driver herself severy injuried [^2].

A police emergency phone line system that has set its limits on receiving emergency call, where a house owner has a house break in and was stab to death while the victim trying to seek the phone line aid cannot reach for help due to the system has reached the limit on a single day.
 
A drug website will always diagnose a forwarding patient to a particular website which sell a particular medicine (for the benefit of the drug company who had hired the DevOp), ignoring the fact that whether the patient medical history if he/she can or cannot take that medicine, and in result causing a teenage girl death.

Two Boeing Planes crashed together when a potential software error caused the system to fail, killing more than 300 people.

## What contributed to the errors we receiving

We can break it up into the following points:

- __Human Factor__ : 
a fault that the programmer did not comprehend, ignored,
 in ignorance of, poor habits of or the faulty of the programmer part, etc. 
 The errors can also occurs when the user have use the application beyond 
 the original or intended purposes that the programmer did not anticipated 
 or aware of.

- __Mechanical Factor__ :
this errors came from the design of the language,
 or the way the scripts is written. It might be because it is a legacy
  programming language, the scripts might have exceeded the original purposes
   or has reached its limitation or has went far beyond than it was anticipated.

- __Natural Phenomena Factor__ :
a nuisance that neither caused by human, 
machines or known facts, but it is such a cause that, 
such as an Act of God, 
a situation that no reasonable person could have make any precaution to prevent 
it from happening or can predict it will happen. For example, an earthquake that 
never would occurs in such area where the devices were and the equipments 
would unlikely to have expect to take any measure for 
an occurrence of the earthquake. Unexpectedly, 
an overwhelming cold wave occurs that stop the devices from giving correct 
measurement when your scripts are deeply depending on the result of the device 
and some other devices also are depending to your scripts.

### What can a developer do

You can, as a developer, grow awareness to all those fault 
that is under your control. 
DO NOT leave an errors hanging, learn what you can do to opt out from 
those errors. You are an "Engineer", you are suppose to make things work better 
and be responsible to what you make.

### You might also needed to

#### Check your code regularly

check again, re-check again, again and again. Some mistake are not easy to spot, especially when after hugh efforts and hours has been put into a project.

#### Practice as much as you can while you can when you can

Challenge yourself to difficult problems ahead of time, so that when the real deal came up you will have enough skills to diffuse it quick, fast and accurately.

#### Accept feedbacks

Accept feedbacks, good one or bad one. Be more on acceptable to opposition voices. We might be relutance to know our faults, but you never know when will those precautions made through those feedbacks or voices you were relutance to hear have saved you.

#### Know yourself better

Knowing yourself help you to tackle some habits that could cause you to those mistakes. It is a life long lesson that any developer needed to learn.

#### You CANNOT fully avoid all faults

No matter how perfect the application is, there is ought to be an error somewhere. Human nature tends to make us unavoidable to those faults. We don't know everything, you cannot control everything, but this is not an excuse that we can be careless, we can only do what we can do, and we will still end up being responsibilites in the process. Therefore, you must keep learning, accept people feedback and opposition voices, understand that you are not perfect, you cannot control everything and will still make mistake even if you are very careful, but not careless on how you appoach problems at the same time, willing to learn from your mistake, learn from others and gain more experiences, keep trying, never easily give up. Learn from people, learn from history, learn the language pros and cons, study as much as you can. Be more acceptable to new technology, be willing to change or upgrade yourself further.

I hope this message will go through everyone hearts.
