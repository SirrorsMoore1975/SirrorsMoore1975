# A Security Challenge for you
No one will wish their user data are sold to some unknown person(s) or an unknown third parties or entities for their own good, or having his/her private life widely open to all others, and not even for any security reason(s). 

Aside from those malicious hackers and/or attacking groups, over the decade, some well known big tech companies are having high concern over privacy invasion, harvesting user data, security breaches, users' freedom and rights invasion while users are trying to use their technologies provided. Obviously, their tech are by no mean a very conveninence tools to use and has make our life more easier. To that extend, some level of private data are ought to be necessary for some of those tech to work. However, this still gives them __NO RIGHTS__ to use the data as if they own them. How far this __for the better user experience__ should go? I believe as a developer, we got a duty to protect our users from all that, within our limits and abilities.

As a developer, we are 





I self challenge myself to provide free, secure, open software, and promise no privacy invasion shall be conduct upon user of the software I created.
# A Challenge not for everyone
How far can we depart ourselves as a developer from the protection on invasion of privacy and security in today modern world? It is difficult since:- 
- it depends on the clients' need;
- alternative tech are not propular, techs are available but not mature, or alternatives are none existence; 
- the infrastructure of the tech your working company are relying upon;
- the services the working company are supplying to their clients cannot be, or afford to, change (time, contract terms, instructions, etc); and,
- developer's tech preferences or habits, they might not have the time, worries it would lower their abilities, have no interest or cannot provide efforts for a change 

Open, free and secure might sound ideal for some, so this challenge, I wished those who still can resist or afford to do so, like people who are starting a business or those who are willing to change and still can change, accept this as your challenge. By not helping or not aiding on selling your user data to a third parties without user consent is already a good start.

## What can we do? 
How many users are not aware that they are selling their user data without you telling them? 

Before going ahead with the client's demand, try to look for the tech alternatives that can be free from the invasion or use a less invasive technologies, :-

The FAANG Companies
- Facebook
- Apple
- Amazon
- Netflix
- Google

The Non-FAANG companies:
- Microsoft 
- Nvidia
- Intel

  - You know that there are alternative tech available;<br />
OR 
  - the tech is not yet available but you can help contributing;
- The change will not making your life become miserable or unsubstainable;

Then challenge yourself and share that:

I am determined that:-
- I __WILL NOT__ become an accomplice of those companies to become the engine to invade my application users' privacy;
- I __WILL__ respect my users rights and freedoms throught out and __WILL NOT__ sold out my users' data for any other usage but only sololy for the use of my application
- It is my utmost priority to ensure my user security and shall be upheld in all cost

# Disclaimer
By posting the security challenge attempt, I __DID NOT__ meant that:-
- I do not wanted to work with people coming from those tech Companies, 
- I do not wanted to use their products or technologies at all in any way, but freedom, security and privacy should be anyone concern while using them.

And by posting the security challenge attempt, I just meant:-
- I wanted to work with those genius developers who might have been working in FAANG, just not working for the FAANG;
- Especially when privacy, freedom and security are concern, I do not wanted to be part of them or assisting them in any way on providing user private data or information to FAANG or its associated third parties or government entities that they were clearly in breach of those rights. 
- I wanted anyone around, especially developers who might be using their tech to build their products, to grow awareness of, or to influence those to, users' protection on their freedom and privacy, and that, it should always be their utmost important priority to secure their user, and shall be upheld at all cost. 
- Users' data are not assets that are for politics, groups, organization, individual, companies or any entities imaginable to harvest and invested upon, for users' tendencies manipulating, or being weaponized to use for or against particular, or group of, user(s) or for any person/persons/groups benefits/disadvantages.
- There are no such things as to<br>
  - `sacrifice freedom for security` or
  - `I have nothing to hide (but have nothing to give either)`,<br>
  freedom and security are not mutually exclusive.
- Their tech are by no means a very convenience tools, but exposing your user to high risk of security, such as:-
  - letting them to know where your user(s) lives; or, 
  - sending user(s) email data for their better marketing tactics on their user(s); or, 
  - a calendar or email apps that leaks info of your meeting(s) or dates with someone; or
  - w/o user consent: accessing device camera, reading folders and files, accessing device audio, tracking user locations, collecting/transferring user's device data to somewhere, etc; or
  <br>
  are really way too much and must be stopped. <br>
  - You as a developer has:-
    - No rights to control what kind of contents, moral or thoughts your user can or cannot have. 

If you are working in this kind of company, you really should consider what are you doing to yourself and to your user who are or will be using your applications.
