# A Security Challenge for you
No one will wish their user data are sold to some unknown person(s) or an unknown third parties or entities for their own good, or having his/her private life widely open to all others, and not even for any security reason(s). 

Aside from those malicious hackers and/or attacking groups, over the decade, some well known big tech companies are having high concern over privacy invasion, harvesting user data, security breaches, users' freedom and rights invasion while users are trying to use their technologies provided. Obviously, their tech are by no mean a very conveninence tools to use and has make our life more easier. To that extend, some level of private data are ought to be necessary for some of those tech to work. However, this still gives them __NO RIGHTS__ to use the data as if they own them. How far this __for the better user experience__ should go? I believe as a developer, we got a duty to protect our users from all that, within our limits and abilities.

The purpose of this article is to let developer who might be aware of, or value, security and privacy to pay more attention to what they are building for their users/clients.

- It is always my pleasure to work with others who might be coming from the big tech companies industry, but I am discouraged in working at the big tech companies when the tech, product or software they are using has security, privacy or user rights and freedom are in concerns.

- This article intention is to let anyone around, especially developers who might be using the big tech companies' tech to build their products, softwares or applications, to grow awareness of, or to influence those developers or others who build products, software or applications for their users to, users' protection on their user's freedom and privacy, and that, it should always be their utmost important priority to secure their user, and shall be upheld at all cost. 


## What can we do? 
To begin with, you needed to ask yourself a few questions:-
- [x] Do you treasure freedom for user, user privacy, security, user rights, individual thoughts and values?
- [x] Is your position (your jobs, titles, etc) and/or situation (fiancially, legally, etc) your currently in, or about to be in, allow you to make a different?

### Fair Warning: It is a Challenge that is not for everyone
How far can we depart ourselves as a developer from the protection on invasion of privacy and security in today modern world? It is difficult since:- 
- it depends on the clients' need;
- alternative tech are not propular, techs are available but not mature, or alternatives are none existence; 
- the infrastructure of the tech your working company are relying upon, of which it does not allow you to depart from;
- the services the working company are supplying to their clients cannot be, or afford to, change (time, contract terms, instructions, etc); and,
- developer's tech preferences or habits, they might not have the time (or have the time to learn new alternatives), worries that the shift would lower their professional abilities, or have show no interests at all to learn alternative (or maybe he/she cannot provide further efforts for a change due to some reasonable reasons)

Open, free and secure might sound ideal for some, so this challenge, I wished those who still can resist or afford to do so, like people who are starting a business or those who are willing to change and still can change, accept this as your challenge. By not helping or not aiding on selling your user data to a third parties without user consent is already a good start.

## Where can we start?

Try asking yourself this questions:
### Alternative software
Is there alternative software or application that can achieve the same goal you are doing? 

You will be supprise to learn there are alternative software that might be free and open sources and is maintained by a huge group of developers. 

However, it is not always the case that there are available alternatives. If this become the case, consider maybe:-
- build an alternative application replacing it yourself, if possible;
- use the unfortunate software or application, for the moment, and wait until such alternative available and switch to it (you already has tried your best)

### User awareness when using your software
How many users are not aware that they are selling their user data without you telling them? 

Before going ahead with the client's demand, try to look for the tech alternatives that can be free from the invasion or use a less invasive technologies, :-

The FAANG Companies
- Facebook
- Apple
- Amazon
- Netflix
- Google

The Non-FAANG companies:
- Microsoft 
- Nvidia
- Intel

## Understand that...
- Users' data are not assets that are for politics, groups, organization, individual, companies or any entities imaginable to harvest, invested, sold out or manipulate upon, for users' tendencies manipulating, or being weaponized to use for or against particular, or group(s) of, user or for any person(s)/group(s) at their benefits/disadvantages.
- There are no such things as to<br>
  - `sacrifice freedom for security` or
  - `I have nothing to hide (but have nothing to give either)`,<br>
freedom and security can be __BOTH__ obtained at the same time and __ARE NOT__ mutually exclusive to each other.
- Their tech are by no means a very convenience tools, but exposing your user to high risk of security, such as:-
  - letting them to know where your user(s) lives; or, 
  - sending user(s) email data for their better marketing tactics on their user(s); or, 
  - a calendar or email apps that leaks info of your meeting(s) or dates with someone; or
  - w/o user consent: accessing device camera, reading folders and files, accessing device audio, tracking user locations, collecting/transferring user's device data to somewhere, etc; or
  <br>
  are really way too much and must be stopped. <br>
  - You as a developer has:-
    - No rights to control what kind of contents, moral or thoughts your user can or cannot have.
